# Mapbox React

## Description
Boilerplate template for quickly setting up a Mapbox and React application.

## Setup
1. Go to mapbox.com, make an account and follow the prompts
2. On account.mapbox.com, "Create a token"
3. In the root of your project's directory, create an .env file
4. Inside the .env file, copy the following text: 
<code>VITE_MAPBOX_KEY={YOUR MAPBOX KEY}</code> 
    - No curly braces - just paste your Mapbox access key after the equals sign and make sure there are no extra whitespace
    - Make sure the .env file extension is in your git ignore to avoid pushing your key to the repo

## Adding Map Styles
- Pick from a default Mapbox style here: https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/  
<em>OR</em>
- Create a custom map style map here: https://studio.mapbox.com/
